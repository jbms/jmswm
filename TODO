Core functionality:

- Handling more window properties

- Transient handling (maybe)

- Proper use of window properties/standard conformance

DONE - Status bar support

DONE - Restart support (saving all state in window properties)

  Need to know the name of the selected view, selected column number

  Need to know the frame information for every client:

    for each frame:

   view name
   column number
   position in column
   priority
   whether it is selected
   other flags (shaded, bar visible, etc.)

DONE:  Robustness against focus-stealing clients

- Robustness against too many frames per column or columns per view

N/A:  Handle focus change on shading

DONE - Solution to shading and auto-sizing: keep a priority value for each frame

DONE - If the pointer is in a window before a repositiong, it is warped to
  remain in it after.


Suppose all positioning is deferred:


  - Pointer positioning:

 
  If we are positioning the focused client, and the frame window is already mapped:

    Query pointer position.

    If frame window previously contained it, and now it won't, warp.



  Always warp when starting up.

- menu completion


  
  wait for some timeout 100 or 300ms after last change before
  initiating completion -- there will be an assigned completor.

  assigned completer

DONE: handle fixed height properly

DONE: track appropriate net_wm property

DONE: cache fixed height info


- Remember mouse position in frame, and restore it when warping


- Finish frame marking support

- Properly handle frame activity

   Always set the column timer, regardless of whether the newly selected frame is raised or not.

   When a column is no longer the selected column (either because the
   selected view changes, or the selected column changes), the most
   recently active frame should become the selected frame.

   Maintain by-column, by-view, global lists of frames in order of activity
