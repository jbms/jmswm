* Configuration
** DONE Support loading styles from a configuration file
   CLOSED: [2007-05-21 Mon 01:00]
* Miscellaneous
** TODO Perhaps implement a sticky frame feature
Perhaps have it show the frame on any view it is tagged for, and also
on the current view.
** TODO Proper use of window properties/standard conformance
** TODO Fix focus-stealing robustness
** TODO Robustness against too many frames per column or columns per view
Perhaps this can be handled by just showing only one frame at a time
in this case, with no indication that there are other frames behind
it.
** TODO Improve fixed-height frame support (improve the heuristics)
** TODO Transient handling (maybe)
** TODO Remember mouse position in frame, and restore it when warping
** TODO Finish frame marking support
** TODO Need to make a general system for operations on multiple frames
** DONE Make sure that the global frame activity list is updated correctly.
   CLOSED: [2007-03-28 Wed 22:26]
** DONE Maybe select most recently active frame in column when a frame is removed.

* Navigation
** TODO Fix prefix-letter view switching
Change prefix-letter commands to switch to most recent view with the
same name, and then rotate between them after that.
** TODO Better support view namespaces perhaps
This may require status bar applet changes as well.
* Fullscreen
Perhaps change the way fullscreen mode is implemented such that a
fullscreen client isn't in a separate view; rather any change will
bring the client out of fullscreen mode.
** TODO Make fullscreen mode interact better with opening new clients
** TODO Perhaps support programs that try to switch to fullscreen mode themselves
Programs that do this include mplayer and feh.
* Frame layout
** TODO Automatic column rearrangement on frame removal
Perhaps automatically move some clients to another column when removal
of a frame results in there being fewer columns than the desired
number.
** TODO Implement a system for specifying the number of desired columns per view
Perhaps this can be done by simply saving values for each view name.
* Status bar applets
** Volume applet
*** TODO Use ALSA notification to avoid update delay
** Music applet
*** TODO Implement this after setting up music playing system for laptop
** TODO CPU speed applet perhaps
** Mail status applet
*** DONE Support key binding for switching to next mail group
    CLOSED: [2007-05-10 Thu 02:03]
Perhaps mod4-x m
Maybe also support a key for composing mail.
** TODO Devices info (USB, cdrom, mounted devices)
Use inotify on /dev/disk/by-uuid
** TODO ERC applet
* Menu system
** DONE Make completion window not full width of screen for better readability
   CLOSED: [2007-05-10 Thu 02:03]
** TODO Add history for completions
** DONE Fix bookmark completion style
   CLOSED: [2007-05-10 Thu 02:03]
** TODO Add shell command and file completion.
* Program launching
** TODO Add support for startup notification
* Views
** TODO Perhaps store previously-used view names
** TODO Perhaps keep track of common directories for view names
** TODO Perhaps always do automatic frame layout, rather than manual placement
There would need to be ways to give hints to the system, or perhaps
override it.

It would likely be confusing if frames are moved around a lot
automatically.

Maybe support showing multiple views at a time.

* Bugs
** TODO Fix Flash-related hang
   The problem seems to also be related to the persistence system.
** DONE Fix GDB stack traces so that they make sense
   CLOSED: [2007-03-28 Wed 19:33]

** TODO Avoid crashes when invalid keysyms or colors are specified

** DONE Fix bar not being positioned properly in some cases after using xrandr
   CLOSED: [2007-04-07 Sat 16:25]
** DONE Fix mail status not showing up when gnus is not started before wm
   CLOSED: [2007-05-10 Thu 02:02]
Perhaps because /tmp/jbms is not getting created.
* Coding style
** TODO Using namespaces

** TODO Make X event handling more generic/simpler
* Screen locking
** TODO Add screen locking support directly to WM
* Visual apperance
** TODO Look into SYNC extension and _NET_WM_SYNC_REQUEST
