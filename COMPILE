Note:

It is important that waf thinks that the top directory and the build directory have related absolute paths.

For some reason, it sometimes determines inconsistent paths.

For instance: (good example)

$ ./waf configure
Setting top to                           : /home/jbms/shared/task/jmswm 
Setting out to                           : /home/jbms/shared/task/jmswm/build 


Bad example:

$ ./waf configure
Setting top to                           : /home/jbms/shared/task/jmswm 
Setting out to                           : /home/jbms/task/jmswm/build 


The solution is to delete .lock-wafbuild and re-run configure, possibly from ~/shared/task/jmswm


Inconsistent paths can result in all sorts of build problems.
